# Signature Canvas Cursor Fix

## Problem

When toggling between upload signature and e-signature (draw) modes, the cursor was not displaying correctly as a crosshair when returning to the draw mode.

## Root Cause

The signature canvas wasn't being properly reinitialized when switching back to draw mode. The cursor style was being reset and not properly re-applied after the component re-rendered.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced JavaScript Logic

- **Added useEffect for signature method changes**: Now triggers when `signatureMethod` changes to "draw"
- **Mutation Observer**: Watches for style changes on the canvas and ensures cursor stays as crosshair
- **Enhanced cursor enforcement**: Uses `setProperty()` with `'important'` flag for maximum specificity
- **Mouse event handlers**: Added `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseMove`, and `onFocus` handlers to canvas props

### 2. Improved CSS Selectors

Added more specific CSS rules in `index.css`:

```css
/* More specific selectors for signature canvas */
.signature-canvas,
.signature-canvas * {
  cursor: crosshair !important;
}

/* Ensure canvas elements inside signature areas have proper cursor */
canvas:where(.signature-canvas),
canvas:is(.signature-canvas) {
  cursor: crosshair !important;
}

/* Force cursor on any canvas that might be in a signature container */
div:has(> canvas.signature-canvas) canvas,
[data-signature] canvas,
[id*="signature"] canvas {
  cursor: crosshair !important;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Event Handlers

- **onBegin**: Forces cursor to crosshair when drawing starts
- **onEnd**: Maintains cursor as crosshair after drawing ends
- **Canvas props**: Added mouse event handlers for consistent cursor behavior

### 4. Robust Re-initialization

- Added timeout delays to ensure proper canvas mounting
- Mutation observer to detect and fix any style changes
- Cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks

## Key Changes Made

### Application.tsx

1. Enhanced `resizeSignatureCanvas()` function with `setProperty('cursor', 'crosshair', 'important')`
2. Added new useEffect for `signatureMethod` changes with mutation observer
3. Enhanced SignatureCanvas event handlers (`onBegin`, `onEnd`)
4. Added mouse event handlers to canvas props

### index.css

1. Added more specific CSS selectors
2. Enhanced cursor enforcement with modern CSS pseudo-selectors
3. Added fallback selectors for various container scenarios

## Testing Verified

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ Cursor properly displays as crosshair when switching to draw mode
- ✅ Cursor maintains crosshair during drawing
- ✅ Cursor stays crosshair after drawing completion

## User Experience Flow

1. User selects "Upload signature image" → Upload interface shown
2. User switches back to "Draw your signature" → Canvas properly initializes
3. Cursor immediately shows as crosshair ✅
4. Drawing works with proper cursor feedback ✅
5. Cursor remains crosshair throughout interaction ✅

The fix ensures a seamless user experience when toggling between signature input methods.
