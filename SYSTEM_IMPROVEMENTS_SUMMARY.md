## üéØ Major Feature Addition: Netflix-Style Sub-User System for OFFICE Role

### What Was Built
A complete multi-user management system that allows OFFICE users to create and manage multiple sub-users (similar to Netflix profiles) with:
- Individual login credentials
- Granular permissions
- Full audit trail of all actions
- Easy management interface

### Key Benefits
1. **Accountability**: Every action is tracked with who did it, when, and what changed
2. **Security**: Fine-grained permissions control what each sub-user can do
3. **Scalability**: Multiple people can work under one OFFICE account
4. **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for auditing and compliance needs
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add, remove, or modify sub-users

## üìä How Audit Logging Works

### Automatic Logging
When integrated properly, the system automatically logs:
- **Who**: The actor (main user or sub-user)
- **What**: The action performed
- **Where**: The module/section
- **When**: Precise timestamp
- **How**: IP address and user agent
- **Why**: Context and details

### Example Integration
```typescript
// In any controller
import { createAuditLog } from "../utils/auditLogger";

// After performing an action
await createAuditLog({
  userID: req.userID,
  subUserID: req.subUserID || null,
  actorName: req.user.firstname + " " + req.user.lastname,
  actorEmail: req.user.email,
  action: "application_approved",
  module: "applications",
  targetType: "Application",
  targetID: application._id,
  targetName: `${application.firstName} ${application.lastName}`,
  oldValue: "pending",
  newValue: "approved",
  ipAddress: req.ip,
  userAgent: req.headers["user-agent"],
});
```

## üéØ User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Creating a Sub-User
1. Main OFFICE user logs in
2. Navigates to **Sub-User Management**
3. Clicks **Add Sub-User**
4. Fills in:
   - Full name
   - Unique email address
   - Password (min 6 chars)
   - Selects permissions
5. Clicks **Create Sub-User**
6. Sub-user is created and can immediately log in

### Workflow 2: Sub-User Working
1. Sub-user logs in with their email/password
2. System detects it's a sub-user
3. Sub-user sees only features they have permission for
4. Every action is automatically logged
5. Main user can view all actions in Audit Logs

### Workflow 3: Managing Sub-Users
1. Main user can edit sub-user anytime
2. Change permissions on the fly
3. Deactivate sub-user (they can't log in)
4. Change their password if needed
5. Delete sub-user permanently (audit logs preserved)

---

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Features

### Step 1: Update Middleware
Replace `authenticate` with `authenticateWithSubUser` in routes:
```typescript
// Before
app.use("/applications", authenticate, applicationRoutes);

// After
app.use("/applications", authenticateWithSubUser, applicationRoutes);
```

### Step 2: Add Permission Checks
In controllers, check sub-user permissions:
```typescript
if (req.isSubUser && !req.subUser.permissions.editApplications) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: "No permission" });
}
```

### Step 3: Add Audit Logging
Call `createAuditLog()` after important actions:
```typescript
await createAuditLog({
  userID: req.userID,
  subUserID: req.subUserID || null,
  actorName: req.user.firstname + " " + req.user.lastname,
  actorEmail: req.user.email,
  action: "your_action",
  module: "your_module",
  // ... other details
});
```

  icon: <FileText />,
  path: "/office/audit-logs",
}
```

Add to your router:
```typescript
{
  path: "/office/sub-users",
  element: <SubUserManagement />,
},
{
  path: "/office/audit-logs",

}
```

### 3. Integrate Audit Logging
Go through your existing controllers and add `createAuditLog()` calls for important actions.

### 4. Update Middleware
Replace `authenticate` with `authenticateWithSubUser` in routes that should support sub-users.

### 5. Add Permission Checks
Add permission validation in controllers for sub-users.
