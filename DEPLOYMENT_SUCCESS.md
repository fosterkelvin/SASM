# 🚀 SASM Project - Successfully Deployed!

## ✅ Current Status

Your SASM (Student Application and Management System) is now successfully deployed and running for testing:

### 🌐 Application URLs

- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:58019
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:4004

### 🔧 Services Status

- ✅ **Backend**: Running on port 4004 (Node.js/Express with TypeScript)
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 58019 (React with Vite build)
- ✅ **Database**: Connected to MongoDB Atlas

## 📋 What's Working

### Backend Features

- REST API server running on Express.js
- MongoDB connection established
- Authentication system with JWT
- File upload functionality
- Email notifications (via Resend)
- User roles (Student, HR, Office)

### Frontend Features

- React application with TypeScript
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Multi-role dashboards
- Authentication pages (Sign in/Sign up)
- Profile management
- Application management
- Notifications system
- File uploads with signature canvas

## 🎯 Testing the Application

1. **Open the frontend**: http://localhost:58019
2. **Create a new account** or **sign in** with existing credentials
3. **Test the different user roles**:
   - Student Dashboard
   - HR Dashboard
   - Office Dashboard
4. **Try key features**:
   - Profile management
   - Application submission
   - File uploads
   - Notifications

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build for production
npm start      # Start production server
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build    # Build for production
npx serve dist   # Serve built files
```

### Quick Deploy

```bash
# Use the deployment script
./deploy.ps1

# Or manually start both services
npm run install:all   # Install all dependencies
npm run dev:backend   # Start backend
npm run dev:frontend  # Start frontend (in another terminal)
```

## 📝 Next Steps for Production

1. **Environment Configuration**:

   - Update JWT secrets in production
   - Configure production MongoDB database
   - Set up proper email service credentials

2. **Hosting Options**:

   - **Backend**: Deploy to Heroku, Railway, or AWS
   - **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3
   - **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas (already configured)

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Enable compression
   - Set up CDN for static assets
   - Implement caching strategies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts**: Frontend automatically uses alternative port if 5173 is busy
- **Backend not connecting**: Check MongoDB Atlas connection string
- **Frontend build issues**: Ensure Node.js version compatibility (v18+)
- **CORS errors**: Verify APP_ORIGIN in backend/.env matches frontend URL
