# 🚨 URGENT: Force Vercel Rebuild

## Problem

Vercel is still serving the OLD cached build with `localhost:4004` hardcoded.

## ✅ What I Just Did

1. Made a small code change to force a fresh build
2. Committed: `95ba535` - "fix: Force rebuild - ensure DTR uses VITE_API environment variable"
3. Pushed to GitHub

## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (2-5 minutes)

Vercel should automatically detect the push and start building.

### Option 2: Force Redeploy Manually (FASTER - Recommended)

1. Go to **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click on your **SASM project**
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click the **"..."** menu → **"Redeploy"**
6. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** = **NO** ❌ (Force fresh build)
7. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Option 3: Invalidate Build Cache via Vercel CLI

```bash
cd frontend
vercel build --force
vercel deploy --prod
```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Deployment Status

In Vercel dashboard, look for:

- Status: **"Building"** → then **"Ready"**
- Commit: **`95ba535`** (Force rebuild)
- Should take 1-3 minutes

### 2. Test After Deployment

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + Shift + R
3. Open **DevTools** (F12) → **Network** tab
4. Navigate to DTR page
5. Check the request URL:
   - ✅ Should be: `https://sasm.onrender.com/dtr/get-or-create`
   - ❌ NOT: `http://localhost:4004/dtr/get-or-create`

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Current (ERROR):

```
❌ localhost:4004/dtr/get-or-create - ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
```

### After Fresh Build (SUCCESS):

```
✅ https://sasm.onrender.com/dtr/get-or-create - 200 OK
```

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] Vercel shows new deployment building (commit `95ba535`)
- [ ] Deployment status = "Ready"
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Hard refresh the site
- [ ] Network tab shows `https://sasm.onrender.com` (not localhost)
- [ ] DTR loads without errors

## 🚨 If STILL Showing localhost:4004

### Problem: Vercel might be using cached build

### Solution: Force invalidate cache

```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
Settings → General → "Clear Build Cache"
Then redeploy
```

OR manually force rebuild:

```bash
cd d:\CODE\SASM-1\frontend
npm run build
# Check the dist/assets/index-*.js file
# It should contain "sasm.onrender.com" NOT "localhost:4004"
```

## 💡 Why This Happened

Vercel might have cached the build from before we fixed the environment variable. The new commit will force Vercel to:

1. Pull latest code
2. Rebuild from scratch
3. Pick up the correct `VITE_API` environment variable
4. Generate new JavaScript bundles

**Next: Watch your Vercel dashboard for the new deployment!** 🚀
