# Signature Canvas Cursor Fix

## Issue

The cursor was not displaying as a crosshair when hovering over the signature canvas, making it unclear to users where they should draw their signature.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced CSS Cursor Styling**

- Added `!important` declarations to enforce crosshair cursor
- Multiple CSS selectors to override any conflicting styles
- Specific targeting of canvas elements within signature containers

### 2. **Improved SignatureCanvas Configuration**

- Added `onBegin` callback to explicitly set cursor when drawing starts
- Enhanced canvas properties with explicit cursor styling
- Added `touchAction: 'none'` for better touch device support

### 3. **Loading State and Canvas Initialization**

- Added loading state to ensure canvas is properly initialized
- Resize handler to ensure canvas fits container properly
- Better state management for signature pad readiness

### 4. **Better User Experience**

- Added visual hint: "ðŸ’¡ Click and drag in the box below to create your signature"
- Loading indicator while signature pad initializes
- Enhanced visual feedback when signature is captured

## Key Changes Made

### CSS Updates (`index.css`)

```css
/* Force crosshair cursor with high specificity */
.signature-canvas {
  cursor: crosshair !important;
  touch-action: none;
}

canvas.signature-canvas {
  cursor: crosshair !important;
}

/* Additional selectors for better coverage */
canvas[class*="signature"] {
  cursor: crosshair !important;
}
```

### Component Updates (`Application.tsx`)

1. **Enhanced SignatureCanvas props**:

   - `onBegin` callback for cursor enforcement
   - Better styling configuration
   - Proper pen configuration for smooth drawing

2. **Improved state management**:

   - Loading state for canvas initialization
   - Resize handling for responsive design
   - Better error handling

3. **User experience improvements**:
   - Clear instructions
   - Loading indicator
   - Visual feedback

## Technical Details

- **Cursor Priority**: Uses `!important` declarations to override any conflicting CSS
- **Touch Support**: Proper `touchAction: 'none'` for mobile devices
- **Responsive Design**: Canvas adapts to container width while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Performance**: Throttled drawing for smooth signature capture

## Testing

The cursor should now:

1. âœ… Display as crosshair when hovering over signature area
2. âœ… Remain as crosshair while drawing
3. âœ… Work on both desktop and touch devices
4. âœ… Provide clear visual feedback to users

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Touch devices (tablets, phones)
- High DPI displays
