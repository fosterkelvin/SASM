# ‚úÖ Deployment Fix Checklist - DTR localhost Error

## Problem Fixed

The DTR component was using the wrong environment variable name (`VITE_API_URL` instead of `VITE_API`), causing it to fall back to `localhost:4004` in production.

## What Was Changed

- **File:** `frontend/src/pages/Roles/Student/DTR/Dtr.tsx`
- **Line 37:** Changed from `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` to `import.meta.env.VITE_API`
- **Commit:** `2ed2ad1` - "fix: Correct API_URL environment variable reference in DTR component"

## ‚úÖ Steps to Complete Deployment

### 1. Verify Code is Pushed ‚úÖ

- [x] Code has been committed
- [x] Code has been pushed to GitHub

### 2. Check Vercel Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel project dashboard:

1. Navigate to: **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
2. Verify this variable exists:
   - **Name:** `VITE_API`
   - **Value:** `https://sasm.onrender.com`
   - **Environment:** Production (and Preview if needed)

### 3. Trigger Vercel Redeployment

Vercel should automatically deploy when you push to GitHub. If not:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on the **latest deployment**
3. Click **"Redeploy"** button
4. Or make a small commit to trigger new deployment

### 4. Wait for Deployment

- Monitor the deployment progress in Vercel dashboard
- Should take 2-5 minutes typically
- Look for "Deployment Successful" status

### 5. Test the Fix

After deployment completes:

1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Visit your deployed site
3. Log in as a student
4. Navigate to the DTR page
5. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
6. Check that requests go to: `https://sasm.onrender.com/dtr/get-or-create`
7. **NOT** `http://localhost:4004/dtr/get-or-create`

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check current environment variable

```bash
# In your Vercel dashboard, or use Vercel CLI:
vercel env ls
```

### Add environment variable if missing

```bash
vercel env add VITE_API
# Enter value: https://sasm.onrender.com
# Select: Production
```

## üìù Additional Notes

### All API calls should now use:

- ‚úÖ `apiClient.ts` ‚Üí Uses `VITE_API` (correct)
- ‚úÖ `Dtr.tsx` ‚Üí Uses `VITE_API` (fixed)

### Environment Files:

- `.env` ‚Üí `VITE_API=http://localhost:4004` (for local dev)
- `.env.production` ‚Üí `VITE_API=https://sasm.onrender.com` (for production)

**Important:** Vite only reads `.env.production` during build time when `NODE_ENV=production`. Vercel automatically sets this.

## üö® If Still Not Working

1. **Hard refresh** the browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Clear browser cache** completely
3. **Check Vercel deployment logs** for build errors
4. **Verify environment variable** is set in Vercel dashboard
5. **Check backend is running** at https://sasm.onrender.com

## üéØ Expected Result

After successful deployment, the DTR page should:

- Load without errors
- Make API calls to `https://sasm.onrender.com`
- No more `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors
- No more `localhost:4004` references in Network tab
