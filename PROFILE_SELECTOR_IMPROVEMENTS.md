# Profile Selector Improvements - Completed

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Hide Main User Profile When No Sub-Users Exist
**Problem**: The main user profile card was always showing, even when no sub-users were created.

**Solution**:
- Added `hasSubUsers` check to conditionally render the main user profile card
- Only shows main user profile card when sub-users exist
- Changes heading from "Who's using SASM?" to "Welcome to SASM" when no sub-users exist
- Shows helpful message: "You haven't created any sub-users yet. Click below to get started!"

**Code** ([ProfileSelector.tsx:59-82](frontend/src/pages/Auth/ProfileSelector/ProfileSelector.tsx#L59-82)):
```typescript
const hasSubUsers = profilesData?.subUsers && profilesData.subUsers.length > 0;

// Only render main user card if hasSubUsers is true
{hasSubUsers && (
  <button onClick={() => handleSelectProfile()}>
    {/* Main User Profile Card */}
  </button>
)}
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed Manage Profiles Button
**Problem**: The "Manage Profiles" button was trying to switch profiles before navigating, causing unnecessary API calls and potential issues.

**Solution**:
- Simplified `handleManageProfiles()` to navigate directly to `/office/sub-users`
- Removed the unnecessary profile switch mutation call
- The main user is already logged in, so no need to switch profiles

**Code** ([ProfileSelector.tsx:35-39](frontend/src/pages/Auth/ProfileSelector/ProfileSelector.tsx#L35-39)):
```typescript
const handleManageProfiles = () => {
  // Navigate directly to sub-users management
  // The main user is already logged in at this point
  navigate("/office/sub-users");
};
```

### 3. ✅ Changed "Logout" to "Sign Out"
**Problem**: The button said "Logout" instead of "Sign Out" (inconsistent with the rest of the UI).

**Solution**:
- Removed the logout button entirely
- Added the `DefNav` navigation bar component (same as signup page)
- DefNav includes the theme switcher and maintains consistent branding

**Code** ([ProfileSelector.tsx:64](frontend/src/pages/Auth/ProfileSelector/ProfileSelector.tsx#L64)):
```typescript
{/* Navigation Bar */}
<DefNav />
```

### 4. ✅ Used DefNav from Signup Page
**Problem**: Custom header with logout button didn't match the design pattern of other auth pages.

**Solution**:
- Imported and used `DefNav` component
- This provides:
  - University of Baguio logo
  - SASM-IMS branding
  - Theme switcher (light/dark mode)
  - Consistent styling with signup/signin pages

### 5. ✅ Updated UI Theme
**Changes**:
- Changed from dark gradient background to light/dark theme support
- Uses `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900` instead of hardcoded dark colors
- All text colors now respond to theme: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- Cards use white background in light mode, gray-800 in dark mode
- Maintains the Netflix-style hover effects and animations

### 6. ✅ Dynamic Button Text
**Enhancement**:
- "Manage Profiles" button changes to "Create Sub-User" when no sub-users exist
- Description changes from "Add or edit sub-users" to "Get started by creating a sub-user"

## Files Modified

1. **[frontend/src/pages/Auth/ProfileSelector/ProfileSelector.tsx](frontend/src/pages/Auth/ProfileSelector/ProfileSelector.tsx)**
   - Added DefNav import and usage
   - Removed LogOut icon import (no longer needed)
   - Added `hasSubUsers` conditional logic
   - Fixed `handleManageProfiles` function
   - Updated all colors to support light/dark themes
   - Added conditional heading and description text
