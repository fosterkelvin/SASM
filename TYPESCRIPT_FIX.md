# TypeScript Build Fix for Render Deployment

## Problem

Render deployment was failing with TypeScript errors:

```
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'cors'
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'cookie-parser'
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'jsonwebtoken'
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'bcrypt'
error TS7006: Parameter 'origin' implicitly has an 'any' type
```

## Root Cause

Render runs `npm install --production` which skips `devDependencies`. TypeScript and type definitions were in `devDependencies`, so they weren't available during the build process.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved TypeScript Dependencies to `dependencies`

Moved these from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`:

- `@types/bcrypt`
- `@types/cookie-parser`
- `@types/cors`
- `@types/express`
- `@types/jsonwebtoken`
- `@types/node`
- `typescript`

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Type Errors

Added explicit type annotations to the CORS configuration in `backend/src/index.ts`:

```typescript
origin: function (origin: string | undefined, callback: (err: Error | null, allow?: boolean) => void)
```

## Changes Made

**File: `backend/package.json`**

- Moved all `@types/*` packages to `dependencies`
- Moved `typescript` to `dependencies`
- Only kept `ts-node-dev` in `devDependencies` (only needed for local development)

**File: `backend/src/index.ts`**

- Added proper TypeScript types to CORS origin callback function

## Result

✅ TypeScript compilation will now succeed on Render
✅ All type definitions available during build
✅ No more implicit 'any' type errors

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes
2. Render will auto-deploy
3. Build should succeed now
4. Backend will be live with cross-origin cookie fix

**Note:** This is a common issue with Node.js deployments. Type definitions and TypeScript itself need to be in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`) when building on hosting platforms that use `--production` flag.
