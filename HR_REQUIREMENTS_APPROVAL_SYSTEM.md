# HR Requirements Approval System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The HR Requirements Management page now includes a **comprehensive approval workflow** where HR staff can review and approve/reject requirements submissions from applicants.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Review Status Tracking**

Every submission now has a review status:

- **Pending** (⏰ Amber) - Submitted but not yet reviewed
- **Approved** (✅ Green) - Reviewed and approved by HR
- **Rejected** (❌ Red) - Needs resubmission or correction

### 2. **Updated Statistics Dashboard**

- **Total Submissions**: All submitted requirements
- **Approved**: Requirements approved by HR
- **Pending Review**: Awaiting HR approval (not yet reviewed or rejected)

### 3. **Approve/Reject Actions**

HR can now:

- ✅ **Approve** submissions directly from the table
- ❌ **Reject** submissions with optional notes
- 👁️ **View** detailed documents before making a decision

### 4. **Student Notifications**

Students receive real-time notifications when:

- Requirements are approved
- Requirements are rejected (with reasons)
- Status changes occur

{
  "submissions": [
    {
      "_id": "...",

## 📊 Statistics Logic

### Before (Old System)

```typescript
Total: All submissions
Complete: Submissions with all files uploaded
Pending: Submissions with missing files
```

### After (New System) ✅

```typescript
Total: All submissions
Approved: reviewStatus === "approved"
Pending Review: reviewStatus === "pending" or undefined
```

**Note**: Rejected submissions can be re-approved by clicking "Approve" again.

## 🔔 Notification System

### When Approved

```javascript
{
  title: "Requirements Approved",
  message: "Congratulations! Your requirements have been approved by HR.",
  type: "success"
}
```

### When Rejected

```javascript
{
  title: "Requirements Rejected",
  message: "Your requirements submission needs attention. [Reason from HR]",
  type: "error"
}
```

### When Set to Pending

```javascript
{
  title: "Requirements Pending Review",
  message: "Your requirements are being reviewed by HR.",
  type: "info"
}
```

## 🎯 User Stories

### Story 1: HR Approves Requirements

```
As an HR staff member
When I view the requirements list
And I see a "Pending" submission
I can click "View" to inspect documents
Then click "Approve"
And the status changes to "Approved" ✅
And the student receives a success notification
```

### Story 2: HR Rejects Requirements

```
As an HR staff member
When I review a submission with issues
I can click "Reject"
And enter a reason (e.g., "Missing signature on form")
Then the status changes to "Rejected" ❌
And the student receives an error notification with the reason
And the student can resubmit
```

### Story 3: HR Re-approves After Rejection

```
As an HR staff member
When I see a "Rejected" submission

```

  });
}
