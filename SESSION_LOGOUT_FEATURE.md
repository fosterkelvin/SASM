# Session Logout Feature Implementation

## Overview

This feature ensures that when a user deletes a session from the "Active Sessions" list in the Profile page, the device associated with that session is immediately signed out and cannot make further authenticated requests.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Authentication Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/authenticate.ts`)

- **Added session validation**: The authentication middleware now checks if the session referenced in the JWT token still exists in the database
- **Made middleware async**: Converted from synchronous to asynchronous function using `catchErrors`
- **Added session expiry check**: Validates that the session hasn't expired
- **Immediate logout**: When a session is deleted, any requests using tokens from that session will immediately fail with 401 Unauthorized

**Key changes:**

```typescript
// Before: Only validated JWT signature
const authenticate: RequestHandler = (req, res, next) => {
  // Only JWT validation
};

// After: Validates JWT + session existence
const authenticate: RequestHandler = catchErrors(async (req, res, next) => {
  // JWT validation + session database check
  if (payload.sessionID) {
    const session = await SessionModel.findById(payload.sessionID);
    const now = Date.now();
    appAssert(
      session && session.expiresAt.getTime() > now,
      UNAUTHORIZED,
      "Session expired or invalid",
      AppErrorCode.InvalidAccessToken
    );
  }
});
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Profile Component (`frontend/src/pages/Profile.tsx`)

- **Added session feedback**: Shows success/error messages when sessions are deleted
- **Better error handling**: Displays specific error messages for session operations
- **Improved UX**: Clear feedback when a session is successfully ended

**Key changes:**

- Added `sessionMessage` state for session-specific feedback
- Enhanced `deleteSessionMutation` with proper success/error handling
- Added visual feedback in the Active Sessions card

## How It Works

### Session Deletion Flow

1. **User clicks delete session**: User clicks the trash icon next to a session in the Profile page
2. **API call**: Frontend calls `DELETE /sessions/:id` endpoint
3. **Session removed**: Backend deletes the session from the database
4. **Immediate effect**: Any subsequent requests from that device using the old session token will fail
5. **Auto-redirect**: The device with the deleted session will be automatically redirected to sign-in page on next API call

### Technical Flow

1. **Token Structure**: JWT tokens contain `userID` and `sessionID`
2. **Validation**: Every authenticated request now validates both JWT signature AND session existence
3. **Session Check**: `authenticate` middleware queries database to ensure session still exists
4. **Immediate Invalidation**: Deleted sessions cause immediate 401 errors
5. **Frontend Handling**: Existing error handling redirects to sign-in page

## Security Benefits

1. **Immediate Logout**: No waiting for token expiry (15 minutes) - devices are logged out instantly
2. **Session Management**: Users can actively manage their active sessions
3. **Security Monitoring**: Users can see all active sessions and remove suspicious ones
4. **Stolen Device Protection**: If a device is stolen, users can immediately revoke its access

## User Experience

### Before

- Deleting a session only removed it from the list
- The device could continue making requests for up to 15 minutes (until token expired)
- No feedback on session deletion success/failure

### After

- Deleting a session immediately signs out that device
- Clear success/error messages for session operations
- Device gets redirected to sign-in page on next request
- Better security control for users

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Query**: Each authenticated request now includes one additional database query to validate session
- **Caching**: Consider implementing session caching if performance becomes an issue
- **Indexing**: Ensure `_id` field in sessions collection is properly indexed (MongoDB does this by default)

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. **Login from multiple devices/browsers**
2. **Go to Profile â†’ Active Sessions**
3. **Delete a session from another device**
4. **Try to navigate or refresh on the deleted session's device**
5. **Verify immediate redirect to sign-in page**

## API Endpoints

- `GET /sessions` - Get all active sessions for current user
- `DELETE /sessions/:id` - Delete a specific session (logs out that device)

## Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: When session doesn't exist or is expired
- **404 Not Found**: When trying to delete a non-existent session
- **Auto-refresh**: Frontend automatically tries token refresh, then redirects to sign-in if session is invalid

## Future Enhancements

1. **Session Details**: Show more session information (IP address, location, last activity)
2. **Session Notifications**: Notify users when new sessions are created
3. **Session Limits**: Implement maximum concurrent sessions per user
4. **Session Analytics**: Track session usage patterns
